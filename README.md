# Chatbot with PyQt5 and TensorFlow

A conversational AI chatbot built using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and TensorFlow for the machine learning model. This chatbot can be used to interact with users, process their input, and provide relevant responses based on the trained model. It also features a smooth gradient background and interactive message bubbles.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A clean and interactive GUI built using PyQt5.
- **Gradient Background**: A smooth gradient effect for a modern look.
- **Chatbot Responses**: Bot responds to user input based on a trained deep learning model.
- **Enter Key Support**: Users can send messages by pressing the Enter key, in addition to clicking the "Send" button.
- **Clear History**: Users can clear the chat history by clicking the "Clear History" button.
- **Message Display**: User and bot messages are displayed in distinct message bubbles for clarity.
